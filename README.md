This repository contains my solutions of the [advent of code challenges](https://adventofcode.com).

Every solution is written in modern C++ and compiled with support for C++17.
Every solution for parts of a task have a tag, which should be handy to quickly obtain the solution.
Currently, the idea is to keep all challenges in corresponding yearly marked folders.

[GoogleTests](https://github.com/google/googletest) is used for testing.
